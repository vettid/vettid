Here is the initial design for VettID. There are more activities to be documented but the materials below should provide enough to begin coding. I will continue documenting the activities until the core functionality is complete. If you are interested in contributing to VettID please contact info@vettid.org. Iâ€™m a lone person with a full time job so I can use the help!

All the best
